# 2. Team Design
![TeamDesign](https://github.com/qc-se-spring23/370Spring23Sec34Team2/blob/main/GroupProject/Design-Team/TeamDesign.png)
### Commonalities 
- The main classes in the UML diagram are Category, Product, Store, and User
- Product class contains the five main attributes: color, size, brand, type and price
- Class associations are clear and visible


### Differences 
- Added User Interface that allows them to Manage and Search for products
- Added ManageStock class which allows the user to add, delete and edit products
- Added SearchStock class which allows the user to search for products


# 3. Summary
In summary, the team successfully collaborated to create a UML class diagram for FlooringIconManager that addresses the requirements provided by Assignment 5. Through the discussion of our individual designs, the team was able to identify commonalities and differences in approaches and made informed decisions about the final design. We also pointed out some of the flaws and redundancies in each individual submission. During the design discussion, we learned the importance of clear and consistent naming conventions for classes, attributes, and methods. Overall, we learned the value of effective communication and collaboration in a team project, as the discussion allowed us to share our ideas and identify strengths and weaknesses in each other's designs.
